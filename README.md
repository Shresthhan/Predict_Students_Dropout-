# ðŸ“š Project Title: Predicting Student Drop-Offs using Machine Learning
ðŸ”¹ Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing student activity data to identify key factors that contribute to dropouts and enable data-informed interventions for improving retention. The main objective is to predict whether a student is at risk of dropping out from a particular opportunity, allowing stakeholders to provide support and guidance at the right time.

Using a range of machine learning models â€” Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost â€” we trained and evaluated their performance in distinguishing dropouts from continuers. The best-performing algorithm (XGBoost) achieved an accuracy of 94% and an F1-score of 0.79 for dropouts, demonstrating strong predictive power.

The project involves extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preparation, feature engineering (such as adding a STEM indicator and calculating apply-to-opportunity intervals), and model training with SMOTE to account for class imbalance. The main factors influencing dropouts include the discipline of study, application and signup patterns, geographic location, and opportunity-related details.

Ultimately, the insights gained from this project can aid educational institutions in developing data-informed strategies to reduce dropout rates, improve retention, and enable greater student success.
